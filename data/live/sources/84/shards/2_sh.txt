Note: Following the ECMAScript standard, the notation someObject.[[Prototype]] is used to designate the prototype of someObject. The [[Prototype]] internal slot can be accessed and modified with the Object.getPrototypeOf() and Object.setPrototypeOf() functions respectively. This is equivalent to the JavaScript accessor __proto__ which is non-standard but de-facto implemented by many JavaScript engines. To prevent confusion while keeping it succinct, in our notation we will avoid using obj.__proto__ but use obj.[[Prototype]] instead. This corresponds to Object.getPrototypeOf(obj).
