# TODO:

### Database
 - create separate 'live' data, backup data, practice data, and data scripts/docs
 - live and backup data should be included in .gitignore, practice data should have a few example databases
 - add npm run scripts to load example databases into live. Alternatively, run app with different scripts and example dbs are loaded dynamically.

In short: clean up and add useful script to enable a good dev-experience

### HTTP backup
- tried to implement backup of data using a http command (/backup). Unfortunately I couldn't get '.backup' or '.dump' commands to work from the nodejs-connection

### Add 'fileEnding' to DB
- I need to dynamically download files by grabbing the file ending of each source file. I will keep this info in the db itself, as a column
