# sources


### Problem to solve

- I want to learn EVERYTHING.
- Obviously, no one can learn everything. but that shouldn't stop one from trying. 
- I should contantly broaden my horizons. This app is made to enable efficient expansion of what I consider familiar territory.
- Simply keep adding 'sources' and their content into this app, and I expect the quuality of the captured content, as well as the retention of new cnotent to improve over time.

<br>

Three steps in this breath capturing phase
1. Capture interesting /meaningfu information (text, code, images, videos, pdfs, etc.)
2. Easily find the information that I caputred (good categorization)
3. Implement a review-system where I am reexposed to all captured information (review system, like anki/memrise) 


<br>

### What problems not to solve
- Collecting mental connections (I do that in extenrnal projects, where I actually create stuff)
	- oviously I can realize thing wher reviewing, but the capturing and organizing of those thought should be directed towards a specific project.
- Really memorizing things by heart. That should be done in a place where the locating and format is very static, to enable more consistent retriaval.
