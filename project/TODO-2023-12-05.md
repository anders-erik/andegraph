# TODO:

### Database
 - create separate 'live' data, backup data, practice data, and data scripts/docs
 - live and backup data should be included in .gitignore, practice data should have a few example databases
 - add npm run scripts to load example databases into live. Alternatively, run app with different scripts and example dbs are loaded dynamically.

In short: clean up and add useful script to enable a good dev-experience

### HTTP backup
- tried to implement backup of data using a http command (/backup). Unfortunately I couldn't get '.backup' or '.dump' commands to work from the nodejs-connection

### Add 'fileEnding' to DB
- I need to dynamically download files by grabbing the file ending of each source file. I will keep this info in the db itself, as a column

### Semver freakout
- whenever I try to copy a backup from windows 11 file explorer, a few files prevent me.
- thien it will get stuck generating copies of semver in node_modules
 - the file generation will continue until I restart WSL 2. Until then, two of my 12700-cores will be running at MAXIMUM
- look at the two images in repo (semver + semver_CPU)

### Created a project management folder
- /project
