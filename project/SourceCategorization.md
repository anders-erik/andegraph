		- 
		- Think music: the classical music tradition really contain a ton of really sophisticated content. Knowing all of that will will really open up modern attempt at music
		- Writing really was more epressive and beatuiful back in the day. It doesn't mean that I should talk like they did in the 1700s, but haing the verbal skill of those influential writer would probably unlock an ability to express myself that I dream of. 
		- memorize the works!
			- Aeneid, dockens, encyclopedia.etc !!!
		- KNOWTHE THINGS THINGS THAT WILL NEVER CHANGE IN YOUR LIFE REALLY WELL.
			- 	keyboard layout, pronounciation, basic words of language, influential historic people, math, emotions, etc.
