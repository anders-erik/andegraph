# Context menu
- Events 
    - hide / show
        - needs to be global in order to make sure that the proper events (show menu, close menu) can be captured. Once captured we can send the event to the context menu module for handling
    - menu clicks
        - locally handle
        - trigger sub-context-menu

# Review
- It would be nice to have access to a small notepad (date, maybe media) that allows me to comment on each contentcard, rather than attached to a particular review?
    - maybe the comments WILL be commected to both!!    
        - YES!

# history
- popstate-event that loads the main content from url
