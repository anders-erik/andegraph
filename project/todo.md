# Todo

- when loading new url-uuid, then update all dom content object elements with same uuid
- when pasting text to editable content cards, that content is not sent to db unless user enter and exit contentEditable mode!
- update project automatically when new child is added
- toggle shardlist overlays on toolbar toggle


# Done

### v0.2.1
- webextension is breaking many app-websites
	- it seems to get stuck in a reload content-script loop
	- Renders it impossible to active in the same session as this app itself, youtube, chatgpt, etc.
- main toolbar moves on smaller screens ( < 1920 width )
- toast is broken (new edge)
